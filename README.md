# bubble_sort

## Milestones

- One of the simpler (but more processor-intensive) ways of sorting a group of items in an array is bubble sort, where each element is compared to the one next to it and they are swapped if the one on the left is larger than the one on the right. This continues until the array is eventually sorted.

- Now create a similar method called #bubble_sort_by which sorts an array by accepting a block, using yield inside the method definition to accomplish this. The block will have two arguments that represent the two elements of the array that are currently being compared. The block’s return will be similar to the spaceship operator you learned about before: If the result of the block execution is negative, the element on the left is “smaller” than the element on the right. 0 means both elements are equal. A positive result means the left element is greater. Use the block’s return value to sort your array.
